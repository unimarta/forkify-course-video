# forkify Project

Recipe application with custom recipe uploads. I learned how to work with a quite big and modern application built using Model View Controller Architecture (MVC).
Features:

1. Search for recipies,
2. Update the number of servings,
3. Bookmark recipies,
4. Create my own recipies,
5. See my bookmarks and own recipies when I leave the application and come back later,
   6.Own recipe upload,
   7.Own recipes automatically bookmarked,
   8.User can only see own recipes, not from others.
