# Forkify Project

This application was a final project of ["The Complete JavaScript Course 2022. From Zero to Expert."](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) - a Udemy Course by **Jonas Schmedtmann**.

Forkify project is a web application that allows us to find recipes using [Forkify API](https://forkify-api.herokuapp.com/v2) also created by Jonas Schmedtmann.

There is a **demo version** that can show us all the possibilities of this application without generating any API key or copying the code. Click [DEMO] (https://forkify-v2.netlify.app/) to try out the application first and find your beloved recipe. I hope you will like it:) What else we can do here???? uploading???? bookmarking????

## This project uses:

- Vanilla JavaScript
- nmp
- Babel
- Parcel
- Model View Controller Architecture (MVC).

## Features:

1. **Search for recipies** - basing on the data from Forkify API that allows us to choose from over 1 million different recipes
2. **Update the number of servings** - increase or decrease the number of servings by special functional buttons marked **+** or **-**. Each ingredient is automatically multiplied or divided by the number of servings we choose.
3. **Bookmark recipies** - choose your favorite recipies and mark as bookmarked. They will be showed on a special bookmarks list and uploaded every time on your site's reload. Anytime you can add or remove your bookmarks from/to the list.
4. **Create my own recipies** - you can add your own recipies to this API and they will also be automatically bookmarked. There is a possibility to add a title, an image and even 6 different ingredients of your recipe.
5. **See my bookmarks and own recipies when I leave the application and come back later** - thanks to your special API key, they will be showed only to you and noone else. Each developer can add as many recipes as he/she wants and use they will be available while using this applicattion.
6. **Own recipe upload**
7. **Own recipes automatically bookmarked**
8. **User can only see own recipes, not from others**

Thank you, **Jonas Schmedtmann**, for providing such a nice project to your course that tought me a lot and thanks to it I could practise my Vanilla JavaScript for over 8 hours long session.
